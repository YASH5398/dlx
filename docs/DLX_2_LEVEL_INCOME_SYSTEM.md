# DLX 2-Level Income System Documentation

## Overview

The DLX 2-Level Income System implements a comprehensive daily income distribution mechanism that rewards users based on their activity status and referral network. The system ensures accurate commission calculations and prevents duplicate income crediting.

## Income Rules

### User Daily Earnings
- **Active Users**: 15 DLX/day (last activity within 24 hours)
- **Inactive Users**: 10 DLX/day (last activity more than 24 hours ago)

### Referral Commission Structure
- **Level 1**: 20% of direct referral's daily DLX earning
- **Level 2**: 10% of second-level referral's daily DLX earning

## Exact Daily Income Calculation Examples

### Level 1 Referrals
- If Level 1 referral is **active** (15 DLX/day) â†’ Sponsor earns 20% = **3 DLX/day**
- If Level 1 referral is **inactive** (10 DLX/day) â†’ Sponsor earns 20% = **2 DLX/day**

### Level 2 Referrals
- If Level 2 referral is **active** (15 DLX/day) â†’ Sponsor earns 10% = **1.5 DLX/day**
- If Level 2 referral is **inactive** (10 DLX/day) â†’ Sponsor earns 10% = **1 DLX/day**

### Database Structure

The system uses the existing Firestore structure with additional fields:

// User document
{
  // Existing fields...
  wallet: {
    miningBalance: number,        // Total mined DLX
    // ... other wallet fields
  },
  totalReferralDLX: number,       // Total referral DLX earned
  level1ReferralIncome: number,   // Level 1 referral income
  level2ReferralIncome: number,   // Level 2 referral income
  lastDailyIncome: timestamp,     // Last daily income distribution
  lastDailyIncomeAmount: number,  // Amount of last daily income
  lastReferralIncome: timestamp,  // Last referral income distribution
  lastReferralIncomeAmount: number, // Amount of last referral income
  lastActivity: timestamp,        // Last user activity
  referrerCode: string,          // Referrer's code
  referralCode: string           // User's referral code
}

// Daily income logs collection
{
  userId: string,
  userDailyEarnings: number,
  level1Income: number,
  level2Income: number,
  totalReferralIncome: number,
  totalDailyIncome: number,
  isActive: boolean,
  level1Referrals: number,
  level2Referrals: number,
  timestamp: timestamp
}
```

## Usage

### Running Daily Income Distribution

```bash
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd scripts

# Run daily income distribution
node distributeDailyIncome.js
```

### Testing the System

```bash
# Set up test referral relationships
node setupTestReferrals.js

# Test the income system
node testDailyIncomeSystem.js
```

### Using in React Components

```typescript
import { useDailyIncome } from '../hooks/useDailyIncome';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    stats,
    getTotalEarnings,
    getLevel1Earnings,
    getLevel2Earnings,
    getUserEarnings,
    getActiveReferralsCount
  } = useDailyIncome();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Total Daily Income: {getTotalEarnings()} DLX</p>
      <p>Level 1 Income: {getLevel1Earnings()} DLX</p>
      <p>Level 2 Income: {getLevel2Earnings()} DLX</p>
      <p>User Earnings: {getUserEarnings()} DLX</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Income Distribution**: All users received appropriate daily income
- **Referral Calculations**: Level 1 and Level 2 commissions calculated correctly
- **Activity Status**: Active/inactive status determined accurately
- **No Duplicates**: No duplicate income credited

### Sample Test Results

```
ðŸ“Š Test Results for Sample User:
- User daily earnings: 15 DLX (Active)
- Level 1 referral income: 11.0 DLX (4 referrals)
- Level 2 referral income: 1.5 DLX (1 referral)
- Total daily income: 27.5 DLX
```

## Automation

### Daily Cron Job Setup

To automate daily income distribution, set up a cron job:

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs daily at 12:00 AM UTC)
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/dlx && node scripts/distributeDailyIncome.js >> logs/daily_income.log 2>&1
```

### Monitoring

- Check `dailyIncomeLogs` collection for distribution history
- Monitor user `lastDailyIncome` timestamps
- Verify income calculations with test scripts

## Security Considerations

- All income calculations are server-side
- User activity status is verified against timestamps
- Referral relationships are validated before processing
- Batch operations prevent race conditions

## Performance Optimizations

- Batch processing (500 operations per batch)
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Minimal data transfer with targeted updates
- Cached user activity status

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time income notifications
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Custom commission rates per user rank
- Referral performance metrics
- Automated payout system
