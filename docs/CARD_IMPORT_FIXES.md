# Card Import Issues - All Fixed âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**

The error `Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/ui/Card.js' does not provide an export named 'Card'` has been completely resolved.

## ðŸ”§ **Root Cause**

The issue was caused by importing named exports from `Card.js` which only provides a default export. The solution was to use the TypeScript version `Card.tsx` which has the proper named exports.

## ðŸ“‹ **Files Fixed**

| File | Status | Fix Applied |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `src/pages/SecretAdmin/AdminUsers2.tsx` | âœ… Fixed | Changed import to `Card.tsx` |
| `src/pages/SecretAdmin/AdminUserRanks.tsx` | âœ… Fixed | Changed import to `Card.tsx` |
| `src/pages/SecretAdmin/AdminTransactions2.tsx` | âœ… Fixed | Changed import to `Card.tsx` |
| `src/pages/SecretAdmin/AdminServiceRequestsEnhanced.tsx` | âœ… Fixed | Changed import to `Card.tsx` |

## ðŸ”„ **Before vs After**

### **Before (Causing Error):**
```typescript
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '../../components/ui/Card';
```

### **After (Working):**
```typescript
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '../../components/ui/Card.tsx';
```

## ðŸ“Š **Card Component Structure**

### **Card.js (Old Version):**
```javascript
// Only provides default export
export default function Card({ children, className = '', title, subtitle, headerRight }) {
  // ...
}
```

### **Card.tsx (New Version):**
```typescript
// Provides named exports
export { Card, CardHeader, CardFooter, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent }
```
